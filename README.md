# Igitsh

This is an interactive shell for Git that facilitates common actions by including shell completions for command names, shell history and removes the need to preface each command with the word `git`.

I originally started this as an [awk script](https://gist.github.com/apainintheneck/ddc87043a645e87f2d9e02b69be155b6). Then, I tried to implement it in a [crystal program](https://github.com/apainintheneck/gitsh-cr) and now I've implemented it in Ruby.

## Installation

```console
$ bundle install
$ bundle rake install
```

## Usage

```console
$ igitsh
```
